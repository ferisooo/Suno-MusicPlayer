# Update Log — Suno Kawaii Player

Newest first. Short notes only.

## v1.2.7 — 2026-06-19
- Added: **🎯 Pick songs** in the Explore bar — a manual alternative to
  auto-detection. Toggle it on, then click any song right in the Suno page to add
  exactly that one (the row highlights pink on hover, flashes green when added,
  and the click no longer navigates/plays). Toggle off to browse normally. Turns
  off by itself when the page reloads.

## v1.2.6 — 2026-06-19
- Fixed: **playlist / library songs weren't detected** — those rows aren't
  `/song/` links (the title navigates via JS), so anchor-only scraping missed
  them and only the playing song slipped through. Now the scraper also reads the
  song id from **cover thumbnails** (their URL embeds the id) and **data-clip
  attributes**, and pulls each title from its row. Avatars/profile pics are
  skipped so they don't show up as phantom songs.
- Fixed: songs whose name couldn't be read no longer collapse into a single
  "Suno song" entry in the import list — placeholders are kept distinct.

## v1.2.5 — 2026-06-19
- Changed: **the player bar now hides while you're in Explore**, so the embedded
  Suno page fills the whole stage and is much bigger to browse. It comes back the
  moment you switch to Library/Playlists (playback keeps going in the background).
- Added: **"🔎 Find all my songs"** in Explore. Suno's lists are virtualized — only
  the rows on screen exist in the page — so the old scrape only caught the first
  screenful. This auto-scrolls your whole library so every song loads and gets
  harvested (titles/covers/lyrics from the page's own feed calls). It also runs
  automatically when you land on your "My songs" page.

## v1.2.4 — 2026-06-19
- Fixed: **import list now refreshes when you move between pages inside Suno**
  (Explore ↔ Library). Detects Suno's in-app route changes and resets + rescans.
- Fixed: **played-detection** — Suno streams audio as a blob (no id), so now a song
  counts as "played" when you click its card in the pane.
- Changed: the Suno pane now **opens to your library** ("My songs") instead of Discover.

## v1.2.3 — 2026-06-19
- Fixed: **songs not showing in the import list**. Now scrapes songs straight from
  the Suno page's DOM (reliable for their Next.js app), on top of the network hooks.
- Changed: the import filter now **shows all songs by default** (the "▶ played"
  toggle hid everything before). Toggle it on to narrow to ones you've played.
- Added: a "Connected to Suno 🎀" ping so you know the page bridge is working.

## v1.2.2 — 2026-06-19
- Fixed: **renderer crash (NOTREACHED) + gray Suno pane** when playing. Removed the
  DevTools debugger that read the Suno page (a known `<webview>` crash source) and
  replaced it with an in-page script (`renderer/suno-preload.js`) that hooks the
  page's own network calls — same song harvesting + played-detection, no crash.
- Added: the Suno pane now auto-reloads itself if it ever crashes.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-06-18
- Fixed: **HTTP 403 when playing/downloading Suno songs** — the CDN was rejecting
  the request. Now sends a `Referer`/`Origin`, retries without the auth header, and
  falls back to the plain public CDN url. Clearer message if it still can't fetch.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-06-18
- Added: **multi-select in Library** — checkbox on each song + "✓ all", with an
  action bar to **Download** (saves the mp3s to a folder you pick) or **Move to a
  playlist**, or remove.
- Added: **played detection** — the import list can show **only songs you actually
  played** in the Suno pane (toggle "▶ played"). Unplayed songs show a pink dot.
- Changed: **import list hides songs already in your Library** and collapses
  duplicate versions of the same title, so it stays clean.
- Removed: the **"Paste a Suno link"** box (account import covers it).
- Note: the pink dots that floated over the Suno pane were just decorative
  particles — the dot is now a real "not played yet" marker in the import list.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-06-18
- Fixed: **Importing from the Suno pane** — Suno hijacks right-click with its own
  menu, so import is now **visible buttons**: each song on the page shows in the
  Explore sidebar with a ＋, plus "＋ All". (In-app library right-click still works
  for adding to playlists.)
- Changed: **"Lists" tab renamed to "Playlists"**, and you can now **name a playlist**
  when you create it (typed in-app, no more auto-numbered names).
- Added: **Backup / Restore** buttons — save your library + playlists to a file and
  load it back, so an update can never lose them.
- Note: imported songs are saved to your Windows profile (`%APPDATA%`), not the app
  folder — so from v1.1 on, replacing the app folder keeps your songs. (Older builds
  didn't save at all, which is why earlier imports vanished.)

## v1.1.0
- Added: **Playlists** tab — make your own lists, right-click songs to add/remove.
- Added: **Import is now opt-in** — right-click a song in the Suno pane to import it,
  or "⬇ Import all here" for the whole page. No more auto-grabbing everything.
- Added: **Live lyrics** panel (for Suno tracks that carry lyrics), auto-scrolls
  with the song and glows the current line.
- Added: **Collapse arrow** (◀/▶ in the title bar) hides the sidebar so the player
  fills the screen.
- Added: **Use Chrome login** (experimental) — tries to import your suno.com cookies
  from Chrome so you skip typing. Falls back to manual login if Chrome locks them.
- Changed: **+Folder removed**, replaced with **Import from my Suno playlists**.
- Changed: **Album art no longer spins** — gentle float + glowing ring instead.
- Changed: **More glow & motion** — glowing title, shimmering active tab, pulsing
  ring, brighter everything.
- Persisted: imported songs + playlists now survive restarts.

## v1.0.x
- Embedded Suno browser inside the player (no popup windows).
- Silenced harmless WebRTC/STUN console errors.
- Brighter shuffle/repeat buttons; repeat is 3-way (off / all / one, with a "1" badge).
- Suno paste-link hardened (browser User-Agent, og:audio scraping, better errors).
- Self-healing launcher fixed (generates a .ps1 instead of inline PowerShell).

## v1.0.0
- First build: kawaii player, frameless window, particles, cursor trail, ripples,
  local + paste-a-Suno-link playback, self-healing start.bat, packaging scripts.
